# Goal

To optimize the performance of a classification model by tuning its hyperparameters using Amazon SageMaker.
This lab demonstrates how to build a baseline model with the Iris dataset, perform automated hyperparameter optimization, and deploy the best model for inference.

# User Interaction

Learners will:

1.Log in to the AWS Management Console and open Amazon SageMaker.

2.Create an S3 bucket and upload the iris.csv dataset.

3.Launch a SageMaker notebook instance to run training and tuning jobs.

4.Execute code cells in the provided Jupyter notebook to:

5.Train a baseline model using XGBoost or another built-in algorithm.

6.Configure and run a Hyperparameter Tuning Job.

7.Compare and analyze results.

8.Deploy the best model as an endpoint and test predictions.

9.Clean up all resources to avoid ongoing costs.
